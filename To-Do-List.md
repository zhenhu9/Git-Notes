## Things needed to do later

```
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration

1. Later Server Configuration's Git-Enforced Policy should be figured out.

2. Git-credential maybe is worth of figuring it out clearly. in git-credential
   man 7, credential helpers are external programs from which Git can request
   both usernames and passwords; They typically interface with secure storage
   provided by the OS or other programs. And it also said that credential
   helpers to cache or store passwords, or to interact with a system password
   wallet or keychain. The most important thing is that I need to figure out
   how my git credential works.

3. Git commit template should be described clearly.
